# Configuration Manager (CM)

## Description

First of all this is a project that i started on my own, as a need for mobile app that i am building.


CM is language independent manager of configurations for any application, mobile, backend system or fronted. 

CM is built on top of sailsJS framework, which natively supports http and web sockets protocols.

Problems that will be solved with CM (at least i see it like this) :

1. language independent
2. centralised
3. secure
4. it can be distributed
5. scales horizontally


### To be done

### Versions 

#### _v0.1_

* added parsing of placeholders
* sample of confs
* refactoring of knockoutJS
